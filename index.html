1. **Rudy Gobert and COVID-19 in 2020**:
   During a media availability on March 9, 2020, Rudy Gobert, an NBA player, touched every microphone and recording device in front of him, seemingly mocking public concerns about COVID-19. Two days later, he tested positive for the virus, becoming the first NBA player to do so. This incident led to a significant disruption in sports, with many leagues suspending their seasons or moving games to 'bubble' environments to minimize contact and prevent further spread of the virus.

2. **Justin Turner's COVID-19 Celebration in 2020**:
   In Game 6 of the 2020 World Series, Los Angeles Dodgers star Justin Turner returned an inconclusive COVID-19 test result but took the field anyway. When his subsequent test came back positive, he was removed from the game. Despite this, Turner celebrated with his teammates without wearing a mask, creating a strange and shocking display of poor decision-making.

3. **Novak Djokovic's Disqualification in 2020**:
   During the 2020 U.S. Open, Novak Djokovic was disqualified after hitting a ball that struck a line judge on their throat. The incident was bizarre because it involved one of the world's top tennis players losing control and causing an unexpected disruption to the match. This event came just a month after Djokovic tested positive for COVID-19 following a large party.`;
