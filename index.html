1. **Rudy Gobert's COVID-19 Incident (2020)**
   During a media availability on March 9, 2020, Rudy Gobert, an NBA player, touched every microphone and recording device in front of him, seemingly mocking the public's concern about COVID-19. Two days later, he tested positive for COVID-19, becoming the first NBA player to do so. This incident led to a significant disruption in the sports world as the NBA season was halted, and teams were forced to play in "bubble" environments to minimize the risk of transmission.

2. **Novak Djokovic's Disqualification at the U.S. Open (2020)**
   Novak Djokovic, one of the world's top tennis players, was disqualified from the 2020 U.S. Open after hitting a ball that struck a line judge on their throat. Although the act was not intentional, it highlighted Djokovic's lack of control during a critical moment in the tournament. This incident occurred just a month after he tested positive for COVID-19 following a large party.

3. **Justin Turner's Maskless Celebration During the 2020 World Series**
   Justin Turner, a star player for the Los Angeles Dodgers, tested positive for COVID-19 during Game 6 of the 2020 World Series but continued to play. After the game, he removed his mask and celebrated with his teammates despite his positive test result. This bizarre display of poor decision-making sparked controversy and highlighted the challenges faced by athletes during the pandemic.`;
